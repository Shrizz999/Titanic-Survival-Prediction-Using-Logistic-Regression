# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
This machine learning project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using the Titanic dataset from OpenML. We use logistic regression, a common classification algorithm, and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy and a confusion matrix.
